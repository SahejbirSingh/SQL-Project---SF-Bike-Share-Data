# SQL-Project---SF-Bike-Share-Data

The bay area’s bike share data, given by a bike rental company named Bike Share, is used to extract meaningful insights. On examining and analyzing the data, the purpose is to verify the statistics and draw actionable conclusions so that the business can run smoothly. From the gathered data, we can mainly identify the most and least preferred bike stations, bike models and routes. We want to determine how different variables can affect the number of bikes rented, along with their duration. Using these insights, we can optimize our resources by allocating more bikes in the most preferred areas, similarly, by identifying the most preferred bike models we can optimize the ratio of different bikes present in a bike station.
The business goals are: -
• Identifying trips with longest duration.
• Identifying how frequently rides are over 24 hours.
• Identifying how many users have subscribed to the service.
• Identifying whether unsubscribed users are taking longer trips or shorter trips.
• Extracting the average duration for trips availed by subscribed users.
• Identifying the most popular start and end stations.
• Identifying most popular routes.
• Identifying how many stations are installed each year in each city.
On analyzing the aforementioned information, we can suggest strategies to improve the efficiency of the business, for example, identifying which why some routes are more
popular, which is because of more available stations in those routes. This suggests that more stations need to be added in the least popular routes.
